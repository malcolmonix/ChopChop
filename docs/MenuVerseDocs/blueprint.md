## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Rich crimson (#D4003A) to evoke feelings of appetite and culinary passion.
- Background color: Off-white (#FAF9F6), nearly the same hue as the primary but heavily desaturated and light, to create a clean and inviting backdrop.
- Accent color: Orange (#D46A00), analogous to crimson, to draw attention to special offers.
- Font pairing: 'Belleza' (sans-serif) for headlines and short chunks of text; 'Alegreya' (serif) for body text.
- Use clear and consistent icons to represent different food categories and actions (e.g., edit, add, delete).
- Design a grid-based layout with clear sections for menu management, image uploads, and post creation.
- Subtle animations for loading states and confirmation messages.
